# Python---Email-Search
The code can be used to search for mails from TradingView in your Gmail ID.

The python code uses imaplib, email and getpass packages to scan your email ID and search for specific email from a website, application, etc.
The code can be used for any gmail ID. 
To use as an example, I am using unread mails triggered to my Gmail ID from Trading View.
For guidance, I have used comments above each step to signify the importance of each line.
