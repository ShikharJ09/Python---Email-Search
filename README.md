# Python---Email-Search
The code can be used to search for specific mail in your mailbox from a website.

The python code uses imaplib, email and getpass packages to scan your email ID and search for specific email from a website, application, etc.
The code can be used for any gmail ID. 
To use as an example, I am using mails triggered to my Gmail ID from Trading View.
For guidance, I have used comments above each step to signify the importance of each line.
